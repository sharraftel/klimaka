the Aim of this project is to design a BMS for SLA batteries, there are many BMS's but almost none specifically designed for SLA.

## End goals:

1- manage each cell and balance it with other cells.

2- over charge and discharge protiction.

3- sofware defined and the cutoff voltage can be configured by comenicating with the controler.

## structure:
the project is divided into three sections, analog circuit one, arduino based one and a pic microchip based one.
